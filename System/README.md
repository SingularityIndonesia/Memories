System project is the abstract of the whole Project. Therefore System project module should be abstraction first if possible.

Things that can be included in the System project are: 
- Business-specific abstractions
- Business-specific interrupts
- Business-specific interceptors (like security interceptors)
- Business-specific services (like encryption) 
- and general abstractions of the entire project's concepts/structure.
