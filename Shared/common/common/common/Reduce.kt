/**
 * This reduce function is a fancy way to inform that the calculation process involves other elements.
 * It aids debugging and refactoring by clearly showing dependencies visually.
 * When used correctly, the bloc body won't be colored purple, indicating it's pure.
 * For instance:
 * ```
 *     val isABlackHole = reduce(
 *         mass,
 *         radius,
 *     ) { m, r ->
 *          val G = 6.6743e-11 // Gravitational constant in m^3/(kg*s^2)
 *          val c = 299792458 // Speed of light in m/s
 *          val SchwarzschildRadius = 2*G*m/(c*c) // BlackHole Radius
 *
 *          return r <= SchwarzschildRadius
 *     }
 * ```
 * In that example, we can see that the calculation process requires 2 elements: mass and radius, and the bloc lamda is a pure function.
